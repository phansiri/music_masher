# Lit Music Mashup - Bug Tracker & Cursor Rules Implementation

## ðŸ“‹ 1. Bug Tracker Document (`bug-tracker.md`)

**Key Features:**

- **Living Documentation**: Comprehensive bug tracking with institutional memory[^1][^2]
- **Standardized Templates**: Consistent bug reporting format for easy searchability
- **Educational Context Integration**: Specialized sections for educational software considerations
- **Priority System**: Critical/Medium/Low based on educational impact
- **Pattern Recognition**: Common bug patterns and solutions documented
- **Quality Metrics**: Statistics tracking and early warning indicators

**Educational-Specific Elements:**

- FERPA/COPPA compliance considerations
- Cultural sensitivity issue tracking
- Learning objective alignment monitoring
- Multi-user collaboration bug patterns
- Age-appropriate content validation issues


## ðŸ¤– 2. Cursor Rules File (`cursor-bug-tracking-rules.mdc`)

**Advanced Cursor Integration Features:**

- **Auto-Attachment**: Triggers when working with bug-related files[^3][^4]
- **Mandatory Review Process**: Forces Cursor to check bug tracker before implementing fixes
- **Conflict Detection**: Prevents contradictory solutions without human approval
- **Educational Context Awareness**: Specialized rules for educational software debugging

**Key Cursor Rules Implementation:**

```markdown
---
description: Educational AI platform bug tracking and documentation management rules
globs: 
  - "bug-tracker.md"
  - "**/*bug*.md"
  - "**/*error*.md" 
  - "**/logs/**/*"
  - "**/tests/**/*"
alwaysApply: false
---
```


## ðŸ”§ How This System Works

### **Before Any Fix Implementation:**

1. **Cursor automatically loads** the bug tracking rules when working with relevant files[^3][^5]
2. **Mandatory bug-tracker.md review** ensures no contradictory solutions
3. **Educational context validation** maintains platform's learning mission
4. **Human approval gate** for any conflicting fixes

### **Living Documentation Benefits:**

- **Institutional Memory**: All bugs and fixes preserved for team knowledge[^6][^7]
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring issues and systemic problems
- **Quality Assurance**: Prevents regression and contradictory solutions
- **Educational Focus**: Maintains platform's educational technology mission


### **Cursor AI Integration:**

- **Smart Context Loading**: Rules activate when debugging or working with related files[^4][^5]
- **Automated Documentation**: Reminds to update bug tracker with every fix
- **Educational Awareness**: Ensures fixes consider learning outcomes and privacy compliance
- **Collaborative Debugging**: Supports multi-developer teams with consistent approaches


## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Instructions

### **To Activate This System:**

1. **Place Files in Project Root:**
    - `bug-tracker.md` â†’ Root directory of your project
    - `cursor-bug-tracking-rules.mdc` â†’ `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. **Cursor Will Automatically:**
    - Load rules when working with bug-related files
    - Enforce bug tracker review before fixes
    - Require human approval for contradictory solutions
    - Maintain educational context awareness
3. **Team Workflow:**
    - All developers see consistent bug tracking prompts
    - Living documentation stays current with every fix
    - Educational platform considerations are never forgotten
    - Quality gates prevent regression issues

This system transforms bug tracking from a static process into a **living, intelligent documentation system** that grows with your educational AI platform while maintaining the highest standards for student privacy, cultural sensitivity, and learning effectiveness[^1][^6][^7].

The Cursor rules ensure that every fix contributes to the platform's educational mission rather than just solving technical problems, making this perfect for your specialized educational technology positioning.

# Lit Music Mashup - Prompt Structure Documentation

## 1. Overview

This document defines the comprehensive prompt engineering strategy for the Lit Music Mashup AI agent system, specifically designed for educational music generation and theory integration. The system uses Pydantic models for structured I/O and LangGraph for state management, with a focus on local model deployment for the MVP phase and educational data privacy.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 State Management with LangGraph
The system uses LangGraph's StateGraph to manage workflow between specialized educational agents:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict, List, Dict, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel
from enum import Enum

class SkillLevel(str, Enum):
    BEGINNER = "beginner"
    INTERMEDIATE = "intermediate"
    ADVANCED = "advanced"

class EducationalContext(str, Enum):
    CLASSROOM = "classroom"
    WORKSHOP = "workshop"
    INDIVIDUAL_STUDY = "individual_study"
    PEER_LEARNING = "peer_learning"

class AgentState(BaseModel):
    """Central state model for LangGraph educational workflow"""
    messages: List[str] = []
    current_agent: Optional[str] = None
    user_request: Optional["EducationalMashupRequest"] = None
    session_id: str
    iteration_count: int = 0
    errors: List[str] = []
    
    # Agent-specific outputs (aligned with PRD)
    educational_context: Optional["EducationalContextResult"] = None
    genre_analysis: Optional["GenreAnalysisResult"] = None
    hook_options: Optional[List["HookOption"]] = None
    final_composition: Optional["LyricsCompositionResult"] = None
    theory_integration: Optional["TheoryIntegrationResult"] = None
    collaboration_state: Optional["CollaborationResult"] = None
```

### 2.2 Pydantic Model Integration
All agent inputs and outputs use strict Pydantic models for validation and structured data flow:

```python
class EducationalMashupRequest(BaseModel):
    """Unified request model matching PRD specifications"""
    user_prompt: str
    skill_level: SkillLevel
    educational_context: EducationalContext
    learning_objectives: Optional[List[str]] = None
    collaboration_mode: bool = False
    model_preference: str = "local"
    api_key: Optional[str] = None
    session_id: Optional[str] = None

# Example agent function signature
def educational_context_agent(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Process user input through educational context analysis"""
    request = EducationalContextRequest(
        user_input=state.user_request.user_prompt,
        skill_level=state.user_request.skill_level,
        educational_context=state.user_request.educational_context,
        learning_objectives=state.user_request.learning_objectives
    )
    # Process and return updated state
    return state
```

## 4. Local Model Optimization Strategies

### 4.1 Prompt Engineering for Local Models
Local models (Ollama-based) require specific optimization strategies to ensure consistent, high-quality educational output:

**Simplified Instruction Architecture:**
- Use direct, concrete language rather than abstract reasoning chains
- Break complex educational tasks into smaller, sequential steps
- Include explicit formatting requirements with examples
- Provide concrete examples rather than abstract conceptual descriptions
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity

**Context Window Management:**
```python
def optimize_prompt_for_local_model(base_prompt: str, context_data: dict, max_tokens: int = 4096) -> str:
    """Optimize prompts for local model context limitations"""
    
    # Prioritize essential educational information
    essential_context = extract_essential_educational_context(context_data)
    
    # Use compressed, efficient formatting
    compressed_prompt = f"""
EDUCATIONAL TASK: {extract_task(base_prompt)}
LEARNING OBJECTIVES: {essential_context.get('objectives', [])}
INPUT DATA: {compress_input_data(essential_context)}
OUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with required educational fields only
KEY CONSTRAINTS: {extract_key_educational_constraints(base_prompt)}
CULTURAL SENSITIVITY: Ensure respectful representation
"""
    
    # Ensure prompt fits within context window
    if len(compressed_prompt.split()) > max_tokens * 0.75:  # Leave room for response
        compressed_prompt = further_compress_prompt(compressed_prompt, max_tokens)
    
    return compressed_prompt

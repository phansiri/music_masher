# Docker Security Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines the security best practices implemented in the Lit Music Mashup AI Docker configuration and provides guidance for maintaining security in production environments.

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### 1. Non-Root User Execution

**Implementation**: All containers run as non-root user `app`

```dockerfile
# Create non-root user
RUN useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash app

# Set proper ownership
RUN chown -R app:app /app

# Switch to non-root user
USER app
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces attack surface
- Prevents privilege escalation
- Follows principle of least privilege

### 2. Minimal Base Image

**Implementation**: Using `python:3.11-slim` for smaller attack surface

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim as production
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced attack surface
- Smaller image size
- Fewer vulnerabilities

### 3. Multi-Stage Builds

**Implementation**: Separate build and production stages

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build stage
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
# ... build dependencies

# Stage 2: Production stage
FROM python:3.11-slim as production
# ... runtime only
```

**Benefits**:
- Smaller production images
- No build tools in production
- Reduced attack surface

### 4. Resource Limits

**Implementation**: CPU and memory limits for all services

```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 1G
      cpus: '0.5'
    reservations:
      memory: 512M
      cpus: '0.25'
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents resource exhaustion
- Improves system stability
- Protects against DoS attacks

### 5. Health Checks

**Implementation**: Comprehensive health monitoring

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1
```

**Benefits**:
- Early detection of issues
- Automatic container restart
- Improved reliability

### 6. Secure File Permissions

**Implementation**: Proper ownership and permissions

```dockerfile
# Create data directory and set permissions
RUN mkdir -p /app/data && chown -R app:app /app
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Follows security best practices
- Protects sensitive data

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Scanning

### Automated Vulnerability Scanning

Use the provided security scanning script:

```bash
# Scan all project images
./scripts/docker/security-scan.sh scan-all

# Scan specific image
./scripts/docker/security-scan.sh scan-image lit-music-mashup:prod

# Audit dependencies
./scripts/docker/security-scan.sh audit-dependencies

# Check for hardcoded secrets
./scripts/docker/security-scan.sh check-secrets
```

### Recommended Scanning Tools

1. **Trivy** - Comprehensive vulnerability scanner
   ```bash
   # Install trivy
   brew install trivy  # macOS
   sudo apt-get install trivy  # Ubuntu
   
   # Scan image
   trivy image lit-music-mashup:prod
   ```

2. **Docker Scout** - Built-in Docker vulnerability scanning
   ```bash
   # Scan image
   docker scout cves lit-music-mashup:prod
   ```

3. **Bandit** - Python security linter
   ```bash
   # Install bandit
   pip install bandit
   
   # Scan code
   bandit -r app/
   ```

## üîê Secrets Management

### Environment Variables

**Secure Practice**: Use environment variables for sensitive data

```yaml
environment:
  - OLLAMA_BASE_URL=${OLLAMA_BASE_URL}
  - DATABASE_PATH=${DATABASE_PATH}
  - ENVIRONMENT=${ENVIRONMENT}
```

**Avoid Hardcoding**:
- API keys
- Passwords
- Database credentials
- Private keys

### Production Secrets

1. **Use Docker Secrets** (for Swarm mode)
2. **Use Kubernetes Secrets** (for Kubernetes)
3. **Use external secret management** (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

## üö® Security Monitoring

### Logging and Monitoring

**Implementation**: Structured logging with security events

```python
# Example security logging
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

# Log security events
logger.info("user_login", user_id=user_id, ip_address=ip_address)
logger.warning("failed_login_attempt", user_id=user_id, ip_address=ip_address)
```

### Security Event Types

1. **Authentication Events**
   - Successful logins
   - Failed login attempts
   - Password changes

2. **Authorization Events**
   - Permission changes
   - Access denied
   - Role modifications

3. **System Events**
   - Container starts/stops
   - Configuration changes
   - Health check failures

## üîÑ Security Updates

### Regular Updates

1. **Base Image Updates**
   - Monitor for security patches
   - Update base images regularly
   - Test updates in staging

2. **Dependency Updates**
   - Use `uv` for dependency management
   - Regular security audits
   - Automated vulnerability scanning

3. **Runtime Updates**
   - Keep Docker Engine updated
   - Monitor for CVEs
   - Apply security patches promptly

### Update Process

```bash
# 1. Check for updates
docker pull python:3.11-slim

# 2. Rebuild images
./scripts/docker/build.sh build-prod

# 3. Test in staging
./scripts/docker/build.sh run-prod

# 4. Deploy to production
./scripts/docker/build.sh deploy-prod
```

    version: string

# Conversational API Endpoints
POST /api/v1/chat:
  summary: Chat with AI agent for mashup creation
  request:
    session_id: string (optional)
    message: string (required)
    context: object (optional)
  response:
    session_id: string
    agent_response: string

## 4.5 AI Agent Specifications

### 4.5.1 Conversational Flow

The AI agent engages users in a conversational flow to gather sufficient information for creating high-quality educational mashups:

**Information Gathering Phase**
1. **Initial Understanding**: Agent asks about the educational context and goals
2. **Genre Exploration**: Discusses desired musical genres and their characteristics
3. **Cultural Research**: Uses web search to gather current cultural context
4. **Theory Level Assessment**: Determines appropriate music theory concepts
5. **Educational Objectives**: Clarifies specific learning outcomes

**Example Conversation Flow**:
User: "I want to create a mashup for my high school class"
Agent: "Great! I'd love to help create an educational mashup. Could you tell me:

What genres are you interested in combining?
What's the main learning objective for this lesson?
What's your students' current music theory level?"

User: "I want to blend K-pop with traditional jazz, focusing on rhythm patterns"
Agent: [Executes web search for current K-pop trends and jazz rhythm patterns]
"Interesting combination! Let me research current K-pop rhythmic trends...
Based on my search, I found that modern K-pop often uses syncopated patterns
similar to jazz. Would you like to focus on:

Comparing swing rhythms with K-pop's use of triplets
Exploring polyrhythmic patterns in both genres
Teaching about cultural fusion in modern music?"

### 4.5.2 Tool Integration

- **Configuration**: User-provided API key via .env file
- **Usage Scenarios**:
  - Current music trends and artist information
  - Cultural context and historical background
  - Educational resources and teaching methods
  - Music theory explanations and examples

**Tool Call Decision Framework**:
```python
TOOL_DECISION_CRITERIA = {
    "web_search": {
        "triggers": [
            "current trends",
            "recent developments",
            "specific artist information",
            "cultural context beyond knowledge cutoff",
            "teaching resource recommendations"
        ],
        "example_queries": [
            "current K-pop rhythm patterns 2024",
            "jazz education techniques for teenagers",
            "cultural significance of genre fusion"
        ]
    }
}
```
